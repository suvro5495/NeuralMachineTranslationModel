# NeuralMachineTranslationModel
Implemented two neural machine translation (NMT) models using different deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.
1. TensorFlow/Keras NMT Model:
We imported necessary libraries and prepared dummy data for translation.
Implemented a sequence-to-sequence model with an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture.
Trained the model using the provided data and evaluated its performance by performing inference on test data.
Calculated accuracy by comparing predicted translations with ground truth translations.
2. PyTorch NMT Model:
Similar to TensorFlow/Keras, we imported libraries and prepared dummy data for translation.
Defined an encoder-decoder architecture using PyTorch modules.
Implemented functions for training the model, including defining loss, optimizer, and training iterations.
Defined functions for inference and evaluation.
In both implementations, we focused on basic NMT architectures and used dummy data for simplicity. The process involved preparing data, defining model architectures, training the models, and evaluating their performance using accuracy metrics. However, actual deployment would require real-world datasets, fine-tuning of hyperparameters, and potentially more complex architectures to achieve higher translation accuracy.
These implementations serve as introductory examples to NMT and demonstrate the usage of deep learning frameworks for building translation models. They can be extended and customized for specific applications with appropriate data and model adjustments.
